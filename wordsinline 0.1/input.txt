Once upon a time in the cold winter time
170 I left the forest; there was a severe frost.
  I look, it rises slowly uphill
  A horse carrying a cart.
  And while marching, it’s important, in the peace of honor,
  A little horse leads a bridle
  In big boots, in a sheepskin sheepskin coat,
  In big gloves ... and he’s got a marigold!
  "Great, boy!" - Go past yourself! -
  "It hurts you menacingly, as I look!
  Where are the firewood from? "- From the forest, of course;
180 Father, you hear, chopping, but I take.
  (An ax of a lumberjack was heard in the forest.) -
  "Well, does father have a big family?"
  - The family is big, but two people
  All men then: my father and I ... -
  "So there it is! What to call you? "
- Vlasom.-
  "What the hell is a year old for you?" - Sixth passed ...
  Well, dead! - shouted the little bass,
  He rushed under the bridle and strode faster.
  The sun was shining on this picture
190 The child was so hilariously small
  As if all this was cardboard
  It’s as if I’ve been in a children's theater!
  But the boy was a boy alive, real,
  And firewood, and brushwood, and a pinto horse,
  And snow, to the windows of the village,
  And the winter sun cold fire -
  Everything, everything real Russian was,
  With the stigma of an unsociable, dying winter,
  That the Russian soul is so painfully sweet
200 What gives Russian thoughts to minds,
  Those honest thoughts that have no will
  To whom there is no death - push not push,
  In which there is so much anger and pain
In which there is so much love!
